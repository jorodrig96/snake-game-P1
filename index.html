    <!-- TODO
    1. Im going to try and work on creating either a snake or pong game. Still doing my research to see which one is easier for me right now.
    2. Have a cool looking background behind the game board.
    3. Game has to keep track of player score & keep track of high score.
    4. If player wins, game has to return a screen stating "you won".
    5. If computer wins, game has to return a screen stating "loser".
    6. Look for a site that will host my game for free.    -->
